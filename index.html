	<h1>Madtown Munchies by Madison Targum</h1>
	<p>As an out-of-state student at UW-Madison I wanted to get to know my surroundings in a city so different than my own. In New York City we know the city blocks based on the aroma of fresh bagels being rolled in the morning from the shop on the corner or the scent of coffee brewing from the local cart two avenues down. I did not know the shape of this city, or most of the unfamiliar faces of other UW students when I first arrived in Madison. Nevertheless, I knew that through exploring the various food options that Madison has to offer with new friends I would be able to become more adapted to the city and make some fun memories - through the mask of course. Ultimately, this site is for those who want to give their taste buds a good time in Madison and feel out the vibes of the Madison restaurant scene in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions. </p>
	
	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>As a New Yorker I have been taught to be opionated, but more specifically be opionated about eating good food. I think my personal love for exploring different cultural cuisines through dining began with weekly dinner dates with my father. We woud go to our local restaurants and take out joints - the best part of it all was getting to know the people who made up the food industry in my neighborhood. Going into the third grade my father thought I should combine my passion for food and writing by joining my elementary school's food critic club that would meet at 7:45 AM before the bell rang at 8:00 AM. That club, although known for its rather brief meetings, gave me an incentive to take on this persona of a "food critic". THE food critic of the Upper West Side which would land us the occasional free appetizer or dessert for a feature in my column. Now while that persona has been put to rest for the past ten years, I thought it would be fun to bring it back while exploring Madison. Although many places have had to adapt to the trying times we are all in, I thought a good use to this site would be to highlight and emphasize which of Madtown's spots were maintaing their hype. Let's see what a New Yorker thinks of the following Madtown Munchies.</p>
