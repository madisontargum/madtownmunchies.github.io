<h1>Belair Cantina: 3 Salsas a Charm</h1>
	
<h2> 111 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Madison WI 53703 </h2>
	
	
	
<body>
<p>Belair Cantina Madison feautures an array of food options in the realm of Mexican-fusion cuisine. You cannot let the simplicity of their four online menus deter you from the vibrant flavors that come from their tacos such as the carne asada, pollo verde, or homemade chorizo. The menu also feautures vegan and vegetarian options including a taco with soy chorizo, diced potatoes, avocado, and pico de gallo.</p></body>
	
<body><p>It has a beachy taco truck feel in comparison to a more traditional Mexican restaurant, but is a great spot for a casual night out and the perfect place for groups of six or less. The only concern one could have is the wait time-- something we ran ino when we were seated with only twenty minutes left till closing. Not to mention, the pitcher we ordered was not available frozen as advertised and the kitchen was closing giving us a short amount of time to order. Nevertheless, these things do not detract from the zesty flavor of the chips and ambiance of the colorful walls. To our suprise the chips and guac made for a sufficient quick bite as it came with an assortment of three homemade salsas. In the end  our experience at Belair Cantina was more of an introduction to the menu, just a little more of a mild introduction than a spicy one.</p></body>
