<h1>Mactaggart's Market and Deli</h1>
	<h2> 230 Lakelawn Pl, Madison WI 53703 </h2>
<body><p>Mactaggarts: a staple of Langdon St and a staple among the Greek houses that makeup up the quaint delii's perimeter. When I first arrived to campus during move-in week I heard through the grapevine that "Taggs" had the best breakfast sandwiches, made-to-order deli, and custom salads. My parents and I were exhausted from our trips to Target and Bed Bath and Beyond and craved a quick lunch. Missing corner stores and delis from home, I mentioned Mactaggart's. I'll set the scene, we arrived a little before 12:30 PM before the big frat brother rush. Making our way into the somewhat sketchy basmenet we were welcomed by a loud hello from the staff behind the counter. We were then given the run-down on how to fill out our orders. On a slip of paper that was comprised of the variety options to fill the inside of your desired sandwich, you could create the combo that your heart desired by circling your order. Your choices of baked daily breads include sub rolls and foccacia bread or classic marble rye. The variety of wraps range from honey wheat, sun-dried basil tomato, or even a healthier route of a lettuce wrap. Knowing that I would be getting my carbs from cheese curds later in the week, I ordered a lettuce wrap, grilled chicken, tomato, sliced mozzerellla, red-pepper, and avocado. Curious about what the convience store held in terms of everyday items, we decided to stroll the isles while waiting for our order. From toilet paper to Pedialyte to deli sandwiches, Tagg's sells a mish-mosh of things. What is commendable is on the rare occasion they do not have the item you want, it can usually be found and stocked within 24 hours. Our orders were made in approximately 6 minutes which just highlights the quick nature of Taggs. Whether you need a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese to start your day or one to end your night, Taggs is the place for you.</p>
