	<h1>Spring Rolls on State: Hidden in the Smoothie Carts in Library Mall</h1>
	<h2>704-712 State St, Madison, WI 53703 </h2>
	
<body><p>Who knew that one could enjoy something so fresh and vibrant wrapped in rice paper all for the price of $3.50. Hidden within two food carts infront of the University Bookstore on Library Mall, Fresh Cool Drinks Smoothie and Natural Juice Smoothie Carts are home to the best spring rolls in Madison. If you are looking for a filling, nutrient dense, and quick thing on-the go, Kim and Tsui's spring rolls are a must. Options ranging from shrimp, tofu, or avocado roll combos, both Kim and Tsui customize any order to the customer's satisfaction. These rolls are especially unique because of the interaction that comes with buying them. Whether its your first time or your fifth time in a week, these women greet you with a friendly face each time you approach the cart's window. What is nice for college students is that not only can you pay with cash but these carts take Venmo. My personal go-to order is the tofu and avocado spring roll with mild peanut sauce. Each roll consists of crunchy romaine lettuce, rice noodles covered in peanut sauce, and lots of avocado plus whatever protein you desire. </p>
