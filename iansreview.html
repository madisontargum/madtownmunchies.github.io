<p> Carbs on, on carbs, on carbs. Ian's is something you must try while in Madison if you are prepared to spend up to $10 for two slices of pizza. Although the price is steep for cheese and bread, Ian's can be so much more with their variety of speciality slices. Whether you get an iconic Mac and Cheese slice or an adventorous Drunken Ravoili, Ian's will not dissapoint. While their dough is more cake like than crusty and the sauce is not the star of the show, this provides an oilly goodness with unique toppings that you cannot resist at 2am.</p>

<p> Ironically, the first time I tried Ian's pizza was while in isolation housing. In order to lighten up the mood, a few new friends and I decided to Grub Hub a group order of Ian's. Due to the delivery fees and pricing of the two pies, our group paid approximately $60. Although the Mac and Cheese slice was a crowd pleaser, the Tomato Pesto was a little anti-climatic. Nevertheless, there is something for everybody at Ian's.</p>
	
<p>The experience of a late night trip to Ian's is one that will be the end of a perfect night with a group of friends. It is one of the only places that stays open past midnight and has an efficient ordering system to enforce social distancing. At the Ian's location on North Frances St, an employee stands outside at a table taking group orders and annouces when pickup orders are ready. While the lines maybe long, a slice of Ian's is the cherry ontop to a night out.</p>
