<h3>How have the COVID-19 Restrictions Impacted the Food Industry in Madison and Restaurant Flow</h3>
<body><p> Under Phase 1 of Dane County's "Forward Dane Order," restaurants are permitted to have up to 25% capacity within their establishments with tables spaced at least 6 feet apart. Many restaurants will not seat groups more than six in order to accomadate social distancing guidelines. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, 68% are not optimistic that food sales will not return to normal within the following months, and 85% of owners reported lower sales in August 2020 than August 2019.</p>

<p> While there has definetly been a decrease in the activity of dining out in Madison, I do not think these statistics reflect the numbers of amount of students who takeout and use alternate delivery services to have what Madison has to offer. With the return of students to campus, I think the food industry has been revived in someways. The food trucks in Library Mall gives us some kind of normalcy and allows us to support our local buisnesses. Delivery services have in many ways contributed to lessening the economic losses felt when students returned home last spring. As a college student, you are not looking for a three course meal in between classes. Madison offers a wide variety of things on the go that are staples of the city due to the fact that no two places are the same.</p>
